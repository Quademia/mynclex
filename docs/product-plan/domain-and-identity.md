# Domain, Company Identity & Auth — Settled 2026-08-05

*Status: decisions settled in the 2026-08-05 session (domain + company name +
auth/email audit). Nothing here is built yet — this doc records what was
decided and what was found, so the build slices that follow have one source
of truth. Companion registry: [transactional-email.md](transactional-email.md).*

## The settled decisions

### 1. Parent domain: **quademia.com**

All QAcademy-family products move under one parent domain, one subdomain per
product (the UWorld shape — nursing.uworld.com, medicine.uworld.com):

| Product | Future home |
|---|---|
| MyNclex | `nclex.quademia.com` |
| MyTeacher | `teacher.quademia.com` |
| Schools platform (Beta-B) | `schools.quademia.com` |
| MyNMCLicensure | `nmc.quademia.com` (or similar — name at attach time) |

**Why one parent matters (not just branding):** browser cookies can be scoped
to a parent domain and shared across its subdomains. Products on unrelated
domains can never share a login session; sibling subdomains can. This decision
is what keeps future cross-product SSO *possible*. It also means ONE domain to
verify with Resend for email, instead of one per product.

**How the name was chosen:** `qacademynurses.com` (owned, working) was ruled
out as the parent — half the portfolio isn't nursing. `qacademy.com` and
`mynclex.com` are not available to buy. Candidates tested and rejected:
`soaedu.com` (fails the say-it-aloud/spell-it test), the full
consonant+"-ademia" alphabet (only `zademia.com` was available; rejected by
ear), `cuademia.com` (homophone of quademia — word-of-mouth traffic would
land on a domain we don't own), and Rose/Peter family combinations
(best survivor: Rosestone — but weaker education signal). Quademia won every
round on the merits: available, pronounceable one way, spellable once heard,
reads as "academia", subdomains scan well.

**What the Q stands for: "Qualified."** Quademia = Qualified + Academia — the
academy that gets you qualified (NCLEX, NMC licensure, school exams). This is
the public story on the About page and anywhere the name is explained.

### 2. Company name: **Quademia Ltd** (legal = brand)

Nothing is registered yet — "QAcademy Educational Consult" appears in the
gamma repo's email sender but was never incorporated. The company registers
as **Quademia Ltd** (fallback styling if the registrar requires it:
"Quademia Education Ltd").

Why legal name = brand name, at this stage:

- **Card statements.** Paystack shows the legal name (truncated ~22 chars) on
  the customer's bank statement. "QUADEMIA LTD" is recognisable to someone
  who bought from quademia.com; an unrelated legal name reads as an
  unrecognised charge → disputes/chargebacks. Customers are mostly abroad,
  paying by card — this is revenue protection, not cosmetics.
- **Paystack verification.** Upgrading off the free/starter account requires
  registration documents + a bank account in the business name + the website.
  Certificate, bank account and domain all saying "Quademia" makes the review
  trivial; a mismatch invites stalls.
- A split ("Rosestone Ltd trading as Quademia") is legal and was considered —
  rejected as friction without a payoff at this size. Revisit only if a
  holding structure is ever needed.

Registration checklist (Sam, off-platform):
- [ ] Buy `quademia.com` (grab `.org` too if cheap)
- [ ] Name availability check at Ghana ORC before settling exact styling
- [ ] Ask Paystack which registration tier they need (business name vs
      company limited by shares) — the company form is the one that scales
- [ ] Business bank account in the exact registered name
- [ ] Quick trademark sanity check (Ghana + USPTO — customers are US-bound)
- [ ] Social handles (@quademia)

### 3. Rename debt this creates (build-list items when the domain is live)

- Gamma email worker + templates send as
  "QAcademy Educational Consult <noreply@qacademynurses.com>" → becomes
  Quademia + `noreply@quademia.com` once verified in Resend.
- MyNclex hardcodes `support@qacademynurses.com` in two files:
  `app/no-access/page.tsx` and `app/(public)/checkout/callback/page.tsx`.
- Supabase auth redirect allowlists + invite `redirectTo` (built from the
  request `origin` header today — `lib/enrolments/actions.ts`,
  `lib/payments/activate.ts`) must include the new host the day it attaches,
  or invite links silently break. Prefer pinning to an explicit site-URL
  setting over trusting `origin`.

## Auth/email audit findings (same session — the "what exists today" survey)

### Login methods

MyNclex has exactly one: **email + password** (`app/login/actions.ts`).
Accounts come into existence three ways: self-serve `/register`, tutor-add
invite (`lib/enrolments/actions.ts`), pay-first invite
(`lib/payments/activate.ts`) — the invited paths set a password at `/welcome`.

**⚠ There is NO forgot-password flow.** No page, no `resetPasswordForEmail`
call, no link on the login form. A student who forgets their password is
locked out permanently short of manual admin intervention. Gamma already has
the full flow (forgot-password.html, reset-password.html, rate-limit tables)
to crib from. **This is the top auth gap.**

No Google / magic-link / OTP on MyNclex (gamma has Google + magic link;
Beta-B has Google + Microsoft via NextAuth).

### Email

- **No email layer exists.** `workers/` is empty, Resend isn't a dependency.
  The only emails MyNclex has ever sent are Supabase Auth invites.
- **⚠ Unverified whether the Supabase projects are on default SMTP** (needs a
  dashboard check on both). Default SMTP = unbranded sender + a few emails/hr
  rate limit — which would silently break tutor-add onboarding at class size.
  Gamma's prod setup doc (`db/setup/supabase_auth_storage.md`) shows the
  custom-SMTP-via-Resend pattern to replicate.
- The `EMAIL-TRIGGER` marker convention in transactional-email.md has
  drifted: ~15 events are marked "anchor exists, needs marker" but only ONE
  marker exists in code. Needs a tidy pass.
- **Architecture conflict to settle at build time:** transactional-email.md
  says "dedicated email worker"; BUILD_LIST.md ("Email (locked, not built)")
  says React Email sent directly from server actions, no worker. Lean:
  server actions — MyNclex runs server-side already, the Resend key never
  reaches a browser, fewer moving parts. (Gamma's worker pattern also ships
  its shared secret to the browser in `js/config.js` — a flaw to fix there,
  not a pattern to copy.)

### SSO

- **"Sign in with Google": feasible, modest slice.** Enable provider on both
  Supabase projects + button. The real work: a first-time Google user skips
  `/register`, so profile-row + STUDENT-role creation must happen on the
  OAuth callback path or they land half-created.
- **True cross-product SSO: parked.** The three products sit on three
  separate identity systems (MyNclex Supabase pair, gamma Supabase pair,
  Beta-B NextAuth+D1). Same parent domain keeps the door open; merging
  identity systems is a large separate decision and cuts against the
  extraction rule.

### Corrections to standing docs

- **CLAUDE.md said MyNclex uses the "shared QAcademy instance" for Supabase.
  Wrong** — MyNclex has its own dev/prod projects (`xkqxfzfsllxyxpdtcrja` /
  `dehspjcfmhoshcdtsmjq`), separate from gamma's pair. Corrected 2026-08-05.
- `sessions/2026-07.md` and `readiness-packs.md` record "`mynclex.com` → 200"
  as a prod release check, calling it "the separate landing." **We do not own
  mynclex.com** (and it is not for sale). Whatever responded 200 was not ours.
  Left in place as history; do not repeat mynclex.com as a release check.

## Build order (once the domain is bought)

1. **Verify quademia.com in Resend + custom SMTP on both MyNclex Supabase
   projects, branded auth templates** — nothing email-dependent is safe
   before this.
2. **Forgot-password flow** (depends on 1).
3. **Attach `nclex.quademia.com` to the app Worker** (routes block in
   wrangler.jsonc + Supabase redirect allowlist + site URL).
4. **Google sign-in.**
5. Transactional email arc (registry already in transactional-email.md).
6. Cross-product SSO — parked, revisit post-migration of sibling products.
