# MyNclex Build List

Slice-by-slice list of work in the MyNclex product, split by the two
layers MyNclex is built around: the **Bank** (self-study question
bank) and the **Programme** (tutored prep). Each line is one slice.
Not exhaustive — design surprises happen — but the shape is settled
where it's listed.

Status legend: ✅ done · 🔨 in progress · ⏭ next · ⬜ pending

> defensive filter for Phase B (CAT can't be resumed). Banner sub-
> line now mode-aware: timed → "Resume soon — the clock kept running
> while you were away."; untimed → "Pick up exactly where you left
> off."
>
> **4.6b fix — Sequential resume unstuck.** `current` initialised to
> 0 always; on Sequential resume Q1 was SUBMITTED but `pendingAnswers`
> only seeds DRAFT rows, so Q1 re-rendered in 'answering' mode with
> empty state. Sequential locks Prev + grid (4.5c) → student stuck;

>
> Build-list also restructured this session: file now has two top-
> level parts — Part 1 (Bank, existing slice list, phases demoted
> h2 → h3) and Part 2 (Programme, stub for next session's pivot).
>
> See SESSIONS 2026-05-10 for the slice + bug-hunting session.
>
> **Next pick:** **Programme/Cohort architecture pivot (planning).**
> Slice 9.1 (a/b/c) shipped today against a model where one programme
> = one cohort. Sam surfaced the course/cohort split (programme =
> reusable syllabus, cohort = a specific run) before curriculum lands
> in Phase B. He's pausing to plan; next session will rework 9.1's
> table + UI onto the split. When Bank work resumes, the next ⏭ is
> **4.7 — Mark-for-review toggle**.

## Part 1 — Bank

Sources: `docs/product-plan/bank-consumption.html` (parent),
`bank-consumption-attempt-creation.html`, `bank-consumption-runner.html`,
`bank-consumption-cat.html`, `bank-marks-and-scoring.html`.

### Phase A — Database foundation

- ✅ **2.1** Base attempt tables — `nclex_attempts`, `nclex_attempt_items`, `nclex_attempt_answers`, `nclex_attempt_case_snapshots`, `nclex_attempt_trend_snapshots`. Applied to mynclex-dev 2026-05-05.
- ✅ **2.1.5** Marking table — `nclex_question_marks` applied to mynclex-dev 2026-05-06. Polymorphic single table (`target_kind` ∈ QUESTION/CASE, `target_source` ∈ BANK/TUTOR), row-exists toggle (INSERT/DELETE, no `is_marked` column), partial unique indexes per source to handle nullable `tutor_id`. RLS: students INSERT/SELECT/DELETE own rows, SUPER_ADMIN bypass.
- ✅ **2.2** Create-attempt RPCs — applied to mynclex-dev 2026-05-06 in two sub-slices:
  - **2.2a** `_nclex_eligible_unit_pool` (internal helper, single source of truth for "eligible"), `nclex_count_eligible_items` (returns total + by-question-type breakdown JSONB), `nclex_create_attempt` (target-with-drift selection, snapshots into 4 attempt tables, returns attempt_id). Bank source only in v1; tutor support deferred until programme enrolment lands.
  - **2.2b** `nclex_mark_attempt_started` (preflight Start, idempotent), `nclex_discard_attempt` (ABANDONED + hard-delete snapshot rows). Both ownership-checked against auth.uid() with SUPER_ADMIN bypass.
- ✅ **2.3** Submit-answer — `nclex_submit_answer` RPC shipped 2026-05-07 with slice 4.1.1. Thin INSERT into `nclex_attempt_answers` with status / ownership / score-bound guards; scoring stays in TS via `lib/scoring/scoreAttempt`. `nclex_save_progress` was originally deferred to 4.6 (STUDY drafts only) but pulled into 4.5 during planning — became universal save-on-tap, not STUDY-only. See slice 4.5 below + runner.html §9.1.
- ⬜ **2.4** Complete-attempt + cleanup — `nclex_complete_attempt` ✅ shipped 2026-05-07 with slice 4.1.1 (item-equivalent average, status COMPLETED, idempotent). The two sweeps `nclex_timeout_sweep` (flip expired EXAM attempts to TIMED_OUT) and `nclex_orphan_cleanup` (flip stale started-NULL rows + zero-engagement STUDY rows) ⬜ remain — both on pg_cron, separate slice.
- ✅ **2.6** Filter breakdown RPC — `nclex_filter_breakdown(filters)` returning per-axis row counts for the Builder's honest signals. For each of 9 content axes plus the special pool axis, drops that axis's filter from the active set, expands cases to children, groups by the bank-items column. Shipped 2026-05-06 as part of slice 5.1b. Migration `20260506170000_slice_5_1b_filter_breakdown.sql`.
- ✅ **2.5** Scoring + authoring marks — applied 2026-05-06 in four sub-slices:
  - **2.5a** `lib/scoring/` pure module: 5 scoring functions + `computeMarksFromKey` + `scoreAttempt` + Vitest (40 tests).
  - **2.5b** Marks become system-managed in the editor; backfill migration applied to dev.
  - **2.5c** Live readout in every editor; updates as the curator edits.
  - **2.5d** "Max" column added to admin + tutor `/bank/all` list pages.

  Followed by a hygiene pass: 7 dead case-save / trend-save RPCs dropped, `db/rpcs.sql` retired. See `SESSIONS.md` 2026-05-06 entry.

### Phase B — CAT schema & engine

- ⬜ **3.1** CAT schema package (§12.7 of cat.html) — `difficulty_irt` + `difficulty_source` on bank + tutor tables, 5 CAT cols on `nclex_attempts`, 4 CAT cols on `nclex_attempt_items`, audit table `nclex_bank_item_calibration_history`, RPC stubs (`create_cat_attempt`, `cat_next_item`) raising "not yet implemented." Sam-gated dev → prod.
- ⬜ **3.2** Rasch engine — fill in `create_cat_attempt` and `cat_next_item` bodies with TS Rasch (1PL) math per §4 + §10.2. Selection rule per §7, termination per §9.
- ⬜ **3.3** Recalibration job — weekly batch (Sundays 02:00 UTC), 30-response threshold, 70/30 dampened blend. Runtime location TBD (Supabase pg_cron vs Cloudflare Worker).

### Phase C — Runner (smallest visible loop first)

- ✅ **4.1** Runner shell + MCQ vertical slice — shipped 2026-05-07. `app/(app)/(focused)/session/[attempt_id]/` route replaced the stub from slice 5.1a wholesale. Pulled slice 2.3 (`nclex_submit_answer`) and the COMPLETED side of 2.4 (`nclex_complete_attempt`) into the same build — designed alongside their only consumer. **Mode policy:** all 5 modes render as Untimed Learning behaviour for now (per-Q submit, immediate feedback, free nav, no timer, no sequential lock); per-mode deltas land in 4.5. Built from the `design_handoff_bank_consumption/` runner-v2 prototype as concept-not-source — three-channel cell encoding (fill / marked border / current ring), CVD-safe palette (light green vs dark red), right-edge sticky 240px grid sidebar. Five sub-slices:
  - **4.1.1** RPCs — `nclex_submit_answer` (thin: validates ownership + status=IN_PROGRESS, INSERTs `nclex_attempt_answers`, bumps `last_activity_at`; scoring stays in TS via `lib/scoring/scoreAttempt` so the 40-test suite remains the single source of truth) and `nclex_complete_attempt` (aggregates `final_score` as item-equivalent average per `bank-marks-and-scoring.html` §7, sets status=COMPLETED + ended_at, idempotent). Migrations applied to mynclex-dev, smoke-tested across 8 paths (happy / wrong / double-submit lock / score-out-of-bounds / status guard / final score / idempotency / cross-student ownership).
  - **4.1.2** Page shell — `page.tsx` does sealed-projection load (omits `correct_answer_snapshot_json` / `rationale_snapshot` / `rationale_img_snapshot` while status=IN_PROGRESS — Pillar 2 enforced at the server boundary, not RLS) + status branch. `runner.tsx` top-level container + `runner-topbar.tsx` + `runner-footer.tsx` + `runner-grid.tsx` (cells with filter toggles `All / Marked / Unanswered / Wrong`; no case bands yet — those land with 4.3). `actions.ts` carries `submitAnswerAction`, `completeAttemptAction`, `markStartedAction`. New `styles/runner.css` ports the `--rn-*` token block from the design (drops `.mn` namespace; relies on existing `styles/tokens.css` for `--accent` / `--primary` / etc.).
  - **4.1.3** Preflight — pre-Q1 confirm screen that calls `nclex_mark_attempt_started`; skipped when `started_at` is already set on mount. Localstorage skip-preflight flag deferred to slice 4.6.
  - **4.1.4** MCQ live — `<McqRunner mode="answering" | "review">` in `lib/bank/runner/types/mcq.tsx`. Per runner.html §16.1.1, the `mode` prop is **per-item** (UL hybrid). Per-option feedback shows for every option in review mode (no prefixes — role conveyed by border + verdict pill). Shared `<RationaleBlock>` in `lib/bank/runner/rationale.tsx` renders verdict pill + score + rationale prose + image (`max-height: 320px`, `object-fit: contain`). MCQ is the structural starting point for the other 8 types in slice 4.2.
  - **4.1.5** Finish + MCQ-review-from-mount — Finish CTA (last Q post-submit) calls `completeAttemptAction` → `router.refresh()` → page re-loads in review mode. Topbar timer pill swaps from `Untimed` to `Score · NN%`. Footer status copy swaps to review-mode message. Old stub `session-stub.tsx` removed.
- ✅ **4.2** Remaining question types — each as a single component with `mode: "answering" | "review"` prop in `lib/bank/runner/types/<type>.tsx`, plus an `isXxxComplete` helper that the `getSubmitGate` dispatch in `runner.tsx` consults to enable/disable Submit. Per-type design rules captured in `bank-consumption-runner.html` §5 (per type) and §10.2 (submit gates).
  - ✅ **TF** — thin wrapper around `McqRunner` (TfContent / TfCorrect are aliases). Submit gate: must pick.
  - ✅ **SATA** — multi-select toggle, 4 review states (right / wrong / missed / dim). Submit gate: zero allowed (NCLEX standard, "none apply" is valid).
  - ✅ **SELECT_N** — SATA + cap. Toggle caps additions at N; deselect always allowed. Progressive count line above the options ("Select N." → "X of N chosen · tap to deselect" → "X of N chosen · tap a selected option to swap"). Submit gate: exactly N picks.
  - ✅ **MATRIX** — rows × columns grid with one-pick-per-row radiogroup. Visual hierarchy refined in mockup review (outer + per-row borders, lighter header divider, 20px ○/● glyphs). Submit gate: every row answered.
  - ✅ **HIGHLIGHT** — passage with `[[bracketed]]` chunks. **Universal no-hint design** (settled with Sam): chunks render as plain passage text, students must search. Persistent orientation line above the passage is the safety net. The runner takes over stem rendering for this type only — `RunnerQuestionArea` skips its `.rn-stem` render and instruction moves above the passage. Submit gate: zero allowed.
  - ✅ **CLOZE** — sentence with `{N}` markers; native `<select>` per blank in answering mode. Persistent superscript number before each blank, surviving into review. Hint above the stem progresses (empty → "X of N filled" → "all filled"). Submit gate: every blank filled. Review settled in mock B′ (`docs/scratch/cloze-review-mock.html`): per-blank "<num> CORRECT/WRONG" verdict header coloured by state, then flowing-prose rationale block listing every option's per-choice feedback inline (`<correct option label in green> — rationale. <wrong label in soft red> — rationale. ...`). Pill row dropped — coloured labels in the prose carry the answer-key signal.
  - ✅ **DRAG_DROP** — both ORDERED + SENTENCE subtypes via internal `subtype` switch. **Click-to-place** interaction (NOT real HTML5 drag-and-drop — audience is phone-first and HTML5 DnD has poor touch support). ORDERED renders numbered slot list with `target_text` labels; SENTENCE takes over stem rendering with `[N]` markers becoming inline drop boxes (third type to do stem-takeover after HIGHLIGHT and CLOZE). Hint progression matches CLOZE pattern. Submit gate: every slot filled. Review for ORDERED: unified canonical-order cards (number + target_text + correct token text + per-slot rationale stacked inside the green card). Review for SENTENCE: per-slot verdict prose (`<num> CORRECT/WRONG/SKIPPED` + rationale). Both subtypes get a distractor strip at the bottom listing tokens that weren't the rubric for any slot.
  - ✅ **BOWTIE** — literal bow-tie shape with **click-to-place** tokens. 5 empty drop slots in a 3-column × 3-row grid (left-top + centre + right-top in row 2; left-bot + right-bot in row 3, centre spanning the middle column). Token pool below mirrors the three wings as 3 separate bordered cards. Tokens can only land in slots of their own wing; matching-wing slots pulse-glow as drop targets while a token of that wing is armed. Slot-position semantics for left/right: schema's `BowtieAnswer.{left,right}` is unordered `string[]`, so removing slot[0] when slot[1] is filled rotates the second pick up to slot[0] (state derivation stays pure). Submit gate: every wing filled (2 + 1 + 2). Review: bow-tie keeps shape with green-✓ / red-✕ tinted slots; pool columns transform into feedback columns where every wing token shows in SATA's 4-state palette + per-token rationale below. Per-column header summary swaps to "X right · Y wrong".
- ✅ **4.3** Case-block UX — shipped 2026-05-09. Wrapper-aware `.rn-split` layout (Layout C: `minmax(380px, 1fr) minmax(520px, 720px)`, max-width 1240) when current item has `parent_case_id`. Sticky `<CasePanel>` on the left renders case head (title + "X of 6 answered" pill) + scenario block + filtered tab row + tab body. **Strict progressive disclosure**: tabs and entries hide entirely until `visible_from <= case_position`, re-hide on backward nav (no stickiness — students reason at the point in time the case is at). All three tab shapes supported in `<ChartTabBody>`: built-in narrative (with optional `extra_fields` + `omit_time`), built-in structured, custom_narrative (free_text), custom_grid (rows_cols). `<CjmmStrip>` renders above the question column via `RunnerQuestionArea`'s new `topSlot` prop. Topbar gains optional `caseMeta` ("Case N of M · CJMM step X of 6 · &lt;label&gt;") for case-childs. Grid renders subtle tinted bands behind clustered case-child cells (no labels, visual grouping only); bands wrap across grid rows when a case straddles a 5-column boundary. **No grid auto-collapse** — Sam's call: layout C protects the wrapper at its 380px floor even with grid open, manual control respects user agency. **Case-entry banner** (`lib/hints/practice/case-entry-banner.tsx`) — non-modal, sits above `.rn-split`, fades after ~4s, dismissable; fires on every case entry (not first-time only). 4 test cases seeded into mynclex-dev covering all 8 chart-tab shapes and all 9 question types across the case-childs. See SESSIONS 2026-05-09 (4.3) for the layout discussion (3-mock comparison at varying viewports → Layout C), the entry-cue refinement (modal overlay → non-modal hint banner; exit warning deferred to 4.5), and the seed-bug fix (hardcoded `marks=1` violated `score_awarded ≤ marks_snapshot` for non-MCQ types). Exit-while-mid-case warning queues for 4.5 (paired with mode-specific behaviour where free-nav vs sequential becomes meaningful).
- ✅ **4.4** Trend question rendering — shipped 2026-05-09. When current item has `trend_id` and a matching `TrendSnapshot`, runner wraps question area in `.rn-split` (reusing Layout C from 4.3) with sticky `<TrendPanel>` on the left: kind label ("Trend data · &lt;Kind&gt;" via `kindDefaultLabel`, keeping curator + student labels in sync) + optional scenario + read-only row × timepoint table. Ref-range column auto-shows when any row has it set. **No flag rendering on cell values** — verified against the real NGN exam (NCSBN provides ref ranges but never pre-flags abnormal/borderline values; curator-side flags are author guidance only). New "⤬ Trend" pill in `.rn-q-meta` (via `trendBadge` prop on `RunnerQuestionArea`). **No CJMM strip, no progressive disclosure, no entry banner, no grid bands** — trends are scattered standalones per attempt-creation §8.3, not chained. 9 published trend questions in mynclex-dev cover all 6 kinds. Single new file (`lib/practice/runner/trend/trend-panel.tsx`) + edits to `runner.tsx` (`currentTrendId` derivation + `inTrend` branch), `runner-question-area.tsx` (`trendBadge` prop), and `styles/runner.css` (new `.rn-trend*` block mirroring case-block CSS, `.rn-trend-pill` in same family as `.rn-cjmm-pill`). See SESSIONS 2026-05-09 (4.4) for the design discussion + the curator UX bug surfaced (publishing a question without the parent dataset blocks it from attempts) + the 5.6 backlog item that came out of testing.
- ✅ **4.5** Per-mode behaviour — shipped 2026-05-09 across three sub-slices, fully specced before code started; see runner.html §8 + §9.1 + §13 + §15 (settled) and attempt-creation.html §6.1.3 (revised).
  - ✅ **4.5a** Timer + save-on-tap + auto-submit (foundation) — new `nclex_save_progress(attempt_item_id, answer_json)` RPC + new `nclex_expire_attempt(attempt_id)` RPC. Client-side debounced (~500ms) save wired into all 9 per-type runners via `runner.tsx`'s `onAnswerChange`. UL backported from "submit creates row directly" to "save-on-tap → status flip on Submit" via the existing RPC's promotion path; `nclex_submit_answer` updated to no longer overwrite `answer_changes_json` on the DRAFT promotion path. Topbar pill becomes a live tick — stopwatch (untimed) or countdown (timed). New `lib/practice/runner/clock.ts` with `formatClock` (`mm:ss` / `h:mm:ss`) + `tierFor` (30 / 15 / 5 / 1 min with duration-conditional firing). Sticky max-tier-fired ref enforces escalates-only tone progression. Hide toggle (eye-icon, per-attempt scope, locks after first warning). Auto-expire via lazy detection in `page.tsx` + client-side `useEffect` when remaining ≤ 0 — flips status to TIMED_OUT, AUTO_SUBMITs DRAFT rows, inserts SKIPPED rows for items without answers, transitions to review. Commit `3d33394`. See SESSIONS 2026-05-09 (4.5a).
  - ✅ **4.5b** Submission archetypes (Free-batched + Sequential) — mode-aware footer + feedback timing. New `getArchetype(mode)` helper collapses 8 (mode, intent) tuples into 3 groups (UL / FREE_BATCHED / SEQUENTIAL). `itemMode` corrected to keep DRAFT rows in 'answering' (latent 4.5a bug fixed: page reload no longer falsely shows "Loading review data..." for UL DRAFTs). `pendingAnswers` seeds from DRAFT rows on mount so reload restores in-progress state. Free-batched (UT, TFN) removes per-Q Submit; footer is just Next / Finish; Finish-with-blanks confirmation modal in `lib/overlays/practice/`. Sequential (TS) gets per-Q `Submit & continue` (4.5b: advances + saves like Next; lock semantics in 4.5c) + Prev disabled + "no Skip" gate (must commit). `_flushDrafts` helper extracted from `expireAttemptAction` and reused in `completeAttemptAction`. Migration fix for slice 2.2a oversight: `BEFORE INSERT` trigger sets `duration_seconds = requested_count × 90` for timed modes (UWorld pace; real NCLEX averages ~84 sec/Q). Commit `f407c21`. See SESSIONS 2026-05-09 (4.5b).
  - ✅ **4.5c** Sequential lock + case-exit warning + correctness gate — closing layer. Sequential's `Submit & continue` now actually fires `submitAnswerAction` per-Q (DRAFT → SUBMITTED) + advances; `Submit & finish` does the same for last Q + `completeAttemptAction`. Grid clicks short-circuited in Sequential live mode — grid becomes a pure progress indicator. Case-exit warning for FREE_BATCHED only (Sequential locks Prev + grid; UL has per-Q rhythm) when student tries to leave a partly-answered case via Prev / Next / grid; modal in `lib/overlays/practice/case-exit-confirm.tsx` with per-attempt suppression. **Hot-fix** surfaced during testing: per-Q submit was leaking correctness via grid green/red mid-quiz (contradicts §15 "Batched submit at the end" + Pillar 2). Added `revealCorrectness` flag to `deriveCellFill` / `gridCounts` / RunnerGrid: false for batched live, true for UL live + any review state. Wrong filter chip + correctness legend rows hide when gated. Commit `d1490e8`. See SESSIONS 2026-05-09 (4.5).
- ✅ **4.6** History page + Resume detection — shipped 2026-05-10 across two sub-slices + two bug fixes that surfaced during testing. Save-progress half already shipped in 4.5a/b; what was missing was the entry point UX. See SESSIONS 2026-05-10 for the slice + bug-hunting session.
  - ✅ **4.6a** History page (MVP) — new `/student/bank/history` route replacing the Placeholder. Table card listing every attempt the student has (newest first, capped at 50, no pagination): When · Session · Source·Mode · Result · State · action. Status maps to action: COMPLETED/TIMED_OUT → Review →; IN_PROGRESS → Resume → (DRAFT restore from 4.5b takes over); ABANDONED → no link (hidden by default, toggleable). Search input + source/mode filter chips render disabled as visible placeholders for slice 7.1 polish. Source pill always says "Custom" in v1 (forward-compat for Packs/Programmes via SOURCE_LABEL map). Session column reuses `summariseRecent()` from launchers so each row reads as e.g. "Pharmacology · Hard · 25 Q." New folder `lib/practice/history/` (queries / types / format / table) + new `styles/history.css`. Commit `6cdc9dc`. **Hot-fix during testing** — UL students returning to an in-progress attempt saw "Loading review data…" for previously-submitted Qs. Cause: `page.tsx` applies sealed projection while `status=IN_PROGRESS` (Pillar 2), and `clientUnseal` (per-Q envelope from `submitAnswerAction`) is React state lost on reload. 4.5b correctly set `itemMode='review'` for finalised UL rows but the data those rows need to render was nowhere on the page. Fix: narrow follow-up query in the live branch fetches unseal columns ONLY for items whose answer row is finalised (SUBMITTED / AUTO_SUBMITTED / SKIPPED — never DRAFT); threads through `LiveData.seededUnseal`, seeds `clientUnseal` on mount. Pillar 2 holds — only items the student already submitted get unsealed. `PerItemUnseal` moved to canonical home in `lib/practice/runner/types`. Commit `16537f5`.
  - ✅ **4.6b** Resume banner surfaces EXAM attempts (non-CAT) — extends the banner shipped in 5.1c. Drops the `intent='STUDY'` filter from `get-resumable-attempt.ts` (5.1c filtered to STUDY based on the original §15 rule; 4.5a's revised attempt-creation §6.1.3 made timed EXAM resumable mid-timer). Adds `mode != 'CAT'` defensively for Phase B. Banner sub-line now mode-aware: timed → "Resume soon — the clock kept running while you were away."; untimed → "Pick up exactly where you left off." Commit `80fdbfa`. **Hot-fix during testing** — Sequential resume was stuck. `current` initialised to 0 always; on Sequential resume Q1 was SUBMITTED but `pendingAnswers` only seeds DRAFT rows so Q1 re-rendered in 'answering' mode with empty state. Sequential locks Prev + grid (4.5c) → student stuck; RPC blocks resubmit. Fix: `current` initialiser walks items, lands on first index whose answer row is missing or DRAFT — the natural "where you left off" position. Universal across archetypes (Sequential breaks; UL + Free-batched are UX-improved). Commit `823a2bd`.
- ⏭ **4.7** Mark-for-review toggle — runner button, writes to marking table, persists across attempts.
- ⬜ **4.8** Discard / abandon — modal with type-DELETE-to-confirm, calls `nclex_discard_attempt`.
- ⬜ **4.9** Review state polish — read-only post-completion view, list + detail with filters (All / Wrong / Right / By category / Marked).

### Phase D — Builder (the entry point)

- ✅ **5.1** Builder page UI — `app/(app)/student/bank/practice/` shipped 2026-05-06 across four sub-slices, plus a tab restructure and a bug fix:
  - **5.1a** Spine — three sections (Pool, Content, Intent+Mode) + sticky summary, wired to `nclex_count_eligible_items` (debounced live count) and `nclex_create_attempt` (Start). Stub `/session/[id]` runner placeholder + Discard button. Smart-link UX for CNC↔Subcategory and Subject↔BodySystem (the Subject↔BodySystem map is hardcoded in `lib/bank/builder/filter-config.ts` — DB doesn't carry it).
  - **5.1b** Per-row counts — every checkbox row + pool chip carries an honest count of "what you'd get if you ticked this, holding other filters constant." Backed by the new `nclex_filter_breakdown` RPC (slice 2.6).
  - **5.1d** Tags + Topic + Subtopic axes — the remaining three of the 8 content axes. Server-side fetch of distinct values from the published bank.
  - **5.1c** Entry helpers — Resume banner, Recent Quizzes shortcut, Practise-my-weak-spots one-tap. Built as shared components in `lib/bank/entry-helpers/` for reuse on the Dashboard later. v1 weak-spots heuristic: `pool=Incorrect`, 25 Q, Study + Untimed Learning. Will be replaced by real weakness analytics in slice 7.x.
  - **Tab restructure** — Intent + Mode moved to its own tab in front of Filters. Prevents the "fill out filters, then pick CAT, watch them collapse" UX trap.
  - **All-pool-chip fix** — `All` chip now correctly sends *no pool filter* instead of accidentally AND-restricting to marked items.
  - Mobile variant **deferred** — desktop-only for now. See 5.1e below.
- ⬜ **5.1e** Mobile variant — accordion sections + sticky bottom action bar (live count + Start) on ≤720px. Per Claude Design's 390px artboard. Important because audience is phone-first; deferred until the runner exists so we polish a complete pipeline rather than a half one.
- ✅ **5.2** Recent Quizzes — shipped as part of 5.1c. Top-3 finished attempts as one-tap chips; click restores the saved configuration into the Builder form via `parseFilterPayload`.
- ✅ **5.3** Weak-spots quick-start — shipped as part of 5.1c. v1 heuristic only (`pool=Incorrect`); replace with real analytics when slice 7.x lands.
- ✅ **5.4** Unfinished-session banner — shipped as part of 5.1c (Resume banner). Latent until the runner fires `nclex_mark_attempt_started` and writes answers — currently no real students would see it because the runner stub doesn't call those.
- ⬜ **5.5** Curator tag allowlist — admin UI + table flag marking which tags are student-facing. Only allowlisted tags appear in the builder Tags filter. Currently every distinct published tag surfaces.
- ⬜ **5.6** Source breakdown + filter axis — three combined fixes for case/trend visibility in the Builder, surfaced 2026-05-09 during slice 4.4 testing:
  - **Honest per-type count**: extend `nclex_count_eligible_items` + `nclex_filter_breakdown` to break the per-type tally into `standalone` / `case-linked` / `trend-linked`. Today picking `Question type = MCQ` silently drops case-children's MCQs from the count without telling the student — they can't tell that 24+ MCQs sit unreachable inside cases. Surface as a sub-line under the type axis: *"6 standalone MCQs · 24 more inside cases (un-filterable by type)."*
  - **Source breakdown line**: above the live count, show a one-line expectation-setter — *"Standalone × N · Case-linked × M · Trend-linked × P."* Cases take ~6× the time per unit, so a 25-Q quiz with 2 cases lands closer to 60 min than the standalone 30 min. Students need that signal before they hit Start.
  - **Source filter axis**: new Pool-tab axis "Source" with options `All / Standalones only / Cases only / Trends only / Standalones + trends (no cases)`. Lives alongside History + Marked, not in Filters — it's about which corner of the bank you draw from rather than what content is in the question. Real student needs that aren't expressible today: "drill cases this week," "skip cases for a quick session," "grind all my trend questions in one go."
  
  Scheduled after Phase D-E core slices so it lands alongside Phase F analytics polish.

### Phase E — Preflight, results, help

- ⬜ **6.1** Preflight screen — between builder Start click and Q1; shows config summary, mode-specific note, "skip preflight next time" checkbox (per-mode localStorage). Calls `nclex_mark_attempt_started`.
- ⬜ **6.2** Results screen (fixed-length) — score, session-scoped breakdown across 6 axes, transition to Review.
- ⬜ **6.3** CAT summary page — verdict copy, items-administered fact line, **trajectory graph** (theta over question number, with passing-standard reference + per-item marker), per-Client-Needs-Category breakdown, "Compared to your previous CATs" panel, "Review answers" CTA.
- ⬜ **6.4** Help routes — `app/help/[slug]/` (top-level, public, audience-neutral). First articles: `/help/cat`, `/help/payments`. Linked from CAT preflight + summary footer + dashboard CAT card.

### Phase F — Dashboard, history, analytics

- ⬜ **7.1** History page polish — analytics + filtering layered on the MVP shipped in slice 4.6a. Per-attempt-card details (avg score, time-per-Q distribution, accuracy by axis), filter chips (mode, status, date range), sort options beyond newest-first. CAT-attempt cards open to the CAT summary page (slice 6.3) instead of the runner. The MVP list shipped earlier in 4.6a (pulled forward from this slice during 4.5 close).
- ⬜ **7.2** Analytics page — `app/(app)/student/bank/analytics/`. All 6 breakdown axes with topic/subtopic drill-downs, peer percentile, answer-change tracking, time-per-question drill-down. Thin-slice gating.
- ⬜ **7.3** Per-student-per-question state — materialised view over `nclex_attempt_answers` + marking table. Drives Unseen/Seen/Correct/Incorrect counts in the builder. Refresh on attempt completion. Promote to physical table only if measurable bottleneck.
- ⬜ **7.4** Dashboard surface — `app/(app)/student/bank/dashboard/`. Readiness card (with cold-start gating), Client Needs Category breakdown card (compact), trend, coverage, recent activity, CAT card, consistency indicator.

### Phase G — Multi-audience runner entries

- ⬜ **8.1** Tutor preview into runner — tutors hit `/session/[attempt_id]` to QA assigned content; renders in review-style mode.
- ⬜ **8.2** Admin QA into runner — same surface for content review.

### Deferred to v2 (Bank)

Per the planning docs — explicit non-goals for v1, captured here so we don't drift back to them:

- Readiness Pack source path (pre-curated quizzes sold separately) — full plan exists, not in v1 build.
- Programme-assigned source path — depends on the Programme product, not yet built.
- Real (calibrated) pass-probability number — needs real NCLEX outcome data.
- 2PL / 3PL IRT models — Rasch only for v1.
- Hard CAT content-blueprint enforcement — soft tiebreaker only for v1.
- Cases / trends in CAT — standalone-only for v1.
- Statistically validated peer-percentile model — placeholder until real cohort data.
- Saved filter presets in builder — Recent Quizzes covers v1 use cases.
- Faculty / cohort dashboards — institutional product.
- Spaced repetition — different product promise, not what we build.

## Part 2 — Programme

Programme planning passes:

- **2026-04-19 / 04-20** — programme structure, curriculum authoring
  UX, tutor onboarding, payments + enrolment all settled (Cohort /
  Rolling mode dropped on 04-20; visibility now per-activity via
  Live / Draft).
- **2026-05-08** — tutor library architecturally settled, parked until
  programmes / payments / runner ship.
- **2026-05-10** — Phase A scoped: programme list page + create-
  programme modal. Field list locked, schema sketched (provisional —
  expect revisions during build), modal UX agreed.

Sources: `docs/product-plan/main.md` (programme structure + pricing +
tutor onboarding), `curriculum-authoring-ux.md` (tutor authoring
screens), `payments-and-enrolment.md` (self-paid + tutor-added
enrolment), `tutor-nav.html` (global vs programme nav contexts).

### Phase A — Programme foundation

- ✅ **9.1** Programme list + Create + Edit modal — shipped 2026-05-10
  across three sub-slices (b, c added mid-session). Replaces the
  demo-cards stub at `app/(app)/tutor/programmes/page.tsx` with a
  real DB-backed list, plus a single `<ProgrammeFormModal>` that
  handles both create and edit flows. **Provisional shape** — Sam
  surfaced the course/cohort split at session-end; next session will
  rework these onto a programme (syllabus) + cohort (run) model.
  - ✅ **9.1a** Schema + list page — `nclex_programmes` table + RLS
    (SELECT/INSERT/admin policies); `getMyProgrammes()` query;
    `<ProgrammeCard>` with smart schedule line + status pill;
    *Show archived (N)* toggle; empty-state CTA. Migration
    `20260510120000_slice_9_1a_programmes_table.sql`. Wire-up fix:
    `<TutorProgrammeShell>` switched from hardcoded
    `DEMO_PROGRAMME_TITLES` map to `getProgrammeForShell()` so real
    UUIDs no longer 404.
  - ✅ **9.1b** Modal + create flow — `<ProgrammeFormModal>` (10
    fields across 3 sections: Identity / Schedule / Pricing);
    `createProgrammeAction` server action; end-date auto-fill from
    start + length × 7 (with `endDateTouched` flag for tutor
    overrides); `<DiscardConfirm>` + `<ErrorToast>` reuse from
    `lib/overlays/bank/` and `lib/toast/`.
  - ✅ **9.1c** Edit programme — UPDATE RLS policy
    (`nclex_programmes_self_update`); `editProgrammeAction`;
    `<ProgrammeFormModal>` refactored to discriminated `mode:
    'create' | 'edit'`; per-card pencil-icon trigger; overlay-link
    pattern on `<ProgrammeCard>` so the whole card stays clickable
    around the edit button. Submit gated until form is dirty in
    edit mode. Migration
    `20260510130000_slice_9_1c_programmes_update_rls.sql`.

- 🔨 **9.2** Programme/Cohort architecture pivot — planned 2026-05-10,
  build deferred to next session. Sam wants to plan first. The split:
  programme = reusable syllabus + curriculum; cohort = one specific
  run with start/end dates, cohort_size, enrolment, status. Curriculum
  (weeks/modules/activities, landing in Phase B) attaches to the
  programme so improvements propagate to all cohorts; v1 has no
  per-cohort content overrides (settled — single source of truth).
  Cohort-level fields: start_date, end_date, cohort_size, status +
  lifecycle timestamps, live-session schedule, mock due dates,
  enrolments. Slice 9.1's table + UI gets reshaped here.

Phase B+ slices defined after 9.2 lands.

### Deferred to v2 (Programme)

- Public self-serve tutor signup (tutors are manually vetted in v1).
- Payment splits / marketplace billing between QAcademy and tutors.

## How to use this file

When a slice lands, flip ⬜ → ✅ and link the SESSIONS.md entry. When a
slice gets started, flip → 🔨. The "next" marker (⏭) moves down one row
each time we close a slice. Anything found mid-build that doesn't fit
the current slice goes either into a later slice (add a line) or
"Deferred to v2" (with a one-line reason).

Don't expand this into a project plan. Keep it a list.
